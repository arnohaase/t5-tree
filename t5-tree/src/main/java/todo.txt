----
* direct support for icons
* listeners on different parts / possibility to inject the different parts of a tree (e.g. for lazy loading of parts of a tree, or open / close by double clicking the title)
* distinguish between tr:TreeFolder and tr:TreeLeaf
* special class for last child element of a node in a tree --> make special rendering possible
* replace "arbitrary content" with TreeLeaf --> at least indentation
* 'expanded'/'collapsed' instead of 'opened'/'closed'
* styling of FileTree
* push tree elements onto the Environment?
* looped example for explicit tree - department, section, employee
* styling: folder without children
* separate out a TreeStyleModel?
* Attribute showFlexibleStyling (with default=false) --> reduce HTML by default(?)
* override checked state of lazily loaded nodes? But how? We really need to know if the parent node's state is indeterminate - unsure if even that helps

* checked tree
  * show check box for leaf nodes
