todo
----
* sample for form based and persistent tree
* sample with lazy loading, exploring the file system starting at '.'
* TODO comments in TreeNode and CheckableTreeNode
* full-blown 'Tree' component (?)
* recursive data structures
* Bootstrap menu above samples, Layout component
* listeners on different parts / possibility to inject the different parts of a tree (e.g. for lazy loading of parts of a tree, or open / close by double clicking the title)
* distinguish between tr:TreeFolder and tr:TreeLeaf
* why does autoconnect=true not work for TreeNode -> TreeNodeOpenCloseControl?
* special class for last child element of a node in a tree --> make special rendering possible
* replace "arbitrary content" with TreeLeaf --> at least indentation
* 'expanded'/'collapsed' instead of 'opened'/'closed'
* styling of FileTree
* push tree elements onto the Environment
